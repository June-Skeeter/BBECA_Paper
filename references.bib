	abstract = {An eddy covariance system is described which has been developed jointly at a number of European laboratories and which was used widely in {HAPEX}-Sahel. The system uses commercially available instrumentation: a three-axis sonic anemometer and an {IR} gas analyser which is used in a closed-path mode, i.e. air is brought to the optical bench by being ducted down a sampling tube from a point near the sonic anemometer. The system is controlled by specially written software which calculates the surface fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat and carbon dioxide, and displays them in real time. The raw turbulent records can be stored for post-processing. Up to five additional analogue instruments can be sampled at up to 10 Hz and digitised by the sonic anemometer. The instruments are described and details of their operation and connection are presented. The system has relatively low power consumption and can operate from appropriate solar cells or rechargeable batteries. Calibration of the gas analyser needs to be performed typically every 2 or 3 days, and, given that the system requires minimal maintenance and is weather insensitive, it can be operated for the routine collection of surface flux data for extended periods. There are a number of corrections which have to be applied in any eddy covariance system and we describe the system of transfer functions which define our system. Some representative results showing the potential of the system are presented.},

Although considered sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic pressures, the spatial extent of peatlands is poorly constrained. We report the development of an improved global peatland map, {PEATMAP}, based on a meta-analysis of geospatial information collated from a variety of sources at global, regional and national levels. We estimate total global peatland area to be 4.23millionkm2, approximately 2.84\% of the world land area. Our results suggest that previous global peatland inventories are likely to underestimate peat extent in the tropics, and to overestimate it in parts of mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Global wetland and soil datasets are poorly suited to estimating peatland distribution. For instance, tropical peatland extents are overestimated by Global Lakes and Wetlands Database – Level 3 ({GLWD}-3) due to the lack of ground-truthing data; and underestimated by the use of histosols to represent peatlands in the Harmonized World Soil Database ({HWSD}) v1.2, as large areas of swamp forest peat in the humid tropics are omitted. {PEATMAP} and its underlying data are freely available as a potentially useful tool for scientists and policy makers with interests in peatlands or wetlands. {PEATMAP}'s data format and file structure are intended to allow it to be readily updated when previously undocumented peatlands are found and mapped, and when regional or national land cover maps are updated and refined.},

	abstract = {Northern peatlands sequester carbon and emit methane, and thus have both cooling and warming impacts on the climate system through their influence on atmospheric burdens of {CO}2 and {CH}4. These competing impacts are usually compared by the global warming potential ({GWP}) methodology, which determines the equivalent {CO}2 annual emission that would have the same integrated radiative forcing impact over a chosen time horizon as the annual {CH}4 emission. We use a simple model of {CH}4 and {CO}2 pools in the atmosphere to extend this analysis to quantify the dynamics, over years to millennia, of the net radiative forcing impact of a peatland that continuously emits {CH}4 and sequesters C. We find that for observed ratios of {CH}4 emission to C sequestration (roughly 0.1–2 mol mol−1), the radiative forcing impact of a northern peatland begins, at peatland formation, as a net warming that peaks after about 50 years, remains a diminishing net warming for the next several hundred to several thousand years, depending on the rate of C sequestration, and thereafter is or will be an ever increasing net cooling impact. We then use the model to evaluate the radiative forcing impact of various changes in {CH}4 and/or {CO}2 emissions. In all cases, the impact of a change in {CH}4 emissions dominates the radiative forcing impact in the first few decades, and then the impact of the change in {CO}2 emissions slowly exerts its influence.},

	abstract = {Peatland drainage depletes large carbon stocks by increasing carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emissions from the soil. Restoration via re-wetting could play an important role in climate change mitigation, reducing {CO}2 emissions and increasing C storage within peatlands. However, re-wetting leads to a biogeochemical compromise between increased {CO}2 uptake, and enhanced methane ({CH}4) release. The extent of this compromise in re-wetted ecosystems with differing environmental conditions is uncertain. To assess re-wetting effects, we analyzed eddy-covariance flux measurements from a temperate bog near Vancouver, Canada, from two sites that have undergone different restoration techniques. By the end of the 1-year study period, the actively re-wetted, wetter site, was a weak {CO}2 sink (−26.1 ± 6.1 g C-{CO}2 m−2), and the passively re-wetted, drier site, was near {CO}2 neutral (3.8 ± 3.1 g C-{CO}2 m−2). Higher {CH}4 emissions at the wetter site led to a larger radiative balance on 20- and 100-year time horizons, implying that the strong radiative effect of {CH}4 can offset {CO}2 sink strength on shorter to medium timeframes. However, long-term radiative forcing ({RF}) modeling suggests sustained {CO}2 uptake by the wetter site will eventually lead to a cooling effect on the climate. Furthermore, modeling results emphasize that despite both re-wetted peatland sites having a positive {RF} over century timescales, the lack of restoration would have resulted in a significantly larger {RF} beyond the first few decades following restoration. Results highlight the importance of actively re-wetting disturbed peatlands to mitigate climate warming and can be used to inform management decisions.},

	abstract = {Rewetting of disturbed peatlands is an important restoration strategy for climate change mitigation. Previous work primarily focuses on the biogeochemical processes altered by rewetting and few studies have investigated the biophysical impacts, which can diminish or amplify biogeochemical effects beyond the ecosystem scale. We used a paired flux tower approach in a restored peatland to collect year-round eddy covariance data to assess the biophysical impacts of disturbance and management practices. The first site was actively rewetted and is characterized by Sphagnum and white beak-rush with patches of open water. The second site represents a disturbed ecosystem, which underwent natural regeneration and is dominated by scrub pine, Sphagnum, and low shrubs. We found that the actively restored site had higher net radiation compared to the second site due to more surface water ponding and however, the higher aerodynamic conductance at the passively restored site contributed to enhanced daytime turbulent fluxes, and hence, both sites had similar aerodynamic temperatures during the daytime. The actively restored site experienced warmer nighttime and seasonal aerodynamic temperature as much of the excess radiation during the day was stored in the water column and released at night. To achieve restoration goals, higher water tables are now maintained throughout large sections of the bog. The study implies that water table manipulation has the potential to minimize greenhouse gas emissions from the bog, thereby allowing the biophysical impacts of peatland restoration to enhance the biogeochemical benefits. Therefore, it is important to consider both biophysical and biogeochemical changes in peatland restoration management.},

	abstract = {Abstract Agricultural drainage of organic soils has resulted in vast soil subsidence and contributed to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}2) concentrations. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained over a century ago for agriculture and human settlement and has since experienced subsidence rates that are among the highest in the world. It is recognized that drained agriculture in the Delta is unsustainable in the long-term, and to help reverse subsidence and capture carbon (C) there is an interest in restoring drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. However, flooding may increase methane ({CH}4) emissions. We conducted a full year of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at two conventional drained agricultural peatlands (a pasture and a corn field) and three flooded land-use types (a rice paddy and two restored wetlands) to assess the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on {CO}2 and {CH}4 fluxes in the Delta. We found that the drained sites were net C and greenhouse gas ({GHG}) sources, releasing up to 341 g C m−2 yr−1 as {CO}2 and 11.4 g C m−2 yr−1 as {CH}4. Conversely, the restored wetlands were net sinks of atmospheric {CO}2, sequestering up to 397 g C m−2 yr−1. However, they were large sources of {CH}4, with emissions ranging from 39 to 53 g C m−2 yr−1. In terms of the full {GHG} budget, the restored wetlands could be either {GHG} sources or sinks. Although the rice paddy was a small atmospheric {CO}2 sink, when considering harvest and {CH}4 emissions, it acted as both a C and {GHG} source. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the restored sites inhibited ecosystem respiration, making them net {CO}2 sinks. This study suggests that converting drained agricultural peat soils to flooded land-use types can help reduce or reverse soil subsidence and reduce {GHG} emissions.},

This corresponds to a contemporary annual greenhouse gas emission of 1.91 (0.31–3.38) Gt {CO}2-eq. that could be saved with peatland restoration. Soil carbon sequestration on all agricultural land has comparable mitigation potential. However, additional nitrogen is needed to build up a similar carbon pool in organic matter of mineral soils, equivalent to 30–80\% of the global fertilizer nitrogen application annually. Restoring peatlands is 3.4 times less nitrogen costly and involves a much smaller land area demand than mineral soil carbon sequestration, calling for a stronger consideration of peatland rehabilitation as a mitigation measure.},

	abstract = {Peatlands support unique biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services, such as regulating climate and providing freshwater and food. However, land-use change, resource extraction and changing climates are threatening peatlands globally. Restoring degraded peatlands requires re-establishing the key features that drive these ecosystems – the hydrological conditions, chemical properties and characteristic biota. Using the best-available evidence to identify management interventions that will effectively abate threats and restore ecological processes can help facilitate successful conservation. ‘Rapid evidence reviews’ have emerged in healthcare as a method of delivering key research findings to policymakers and decision-makers in a timely manner. Here, we used a rapid review approach to identify, appraise and synthesise scientific evidence on the effectiveness of conservation interventions intended to restore the hydrological conditions, chemical properties and/or characteristic biota of degraded boreal, montane, alpine and temperate peatlands globally. We found that there is consistent evidence that rewetting, shading or mulching, reprofiling, mowing, controlling grazers and active revegetation can improve the condition of degraded peatlands. Taking a whole-system approach was reported as essential to successful conservation because the hydrological conditions, chemical properties and biota are intrinsically linked. There is consistent evidence that restoring peatlands can enhance the ecosystem service of carbon storage. We demonstrate that applying the rapid review approach to a conservation problem: 1) proved efficient for synthesising evidence from 453 individual studies collected through 23 reviews, and 2) yielded a valuable synthesis of the common interventions to support effective, evidence-based conservation and recovery of peatlands globally. This can enable policymakers and practitioners to apply the best-available research knowledge when addressing this important challenge.},

Data on radiation, tree biomass, and soil {GHG} fluxes were combined with models for canopy cover, tree carbon accumulation, and the {RF} due to increased atmospheric {GHG} concentrations for four typical site cases in Finland covering two soil nutrient levels in the south and north of the country. We also studied the observed long-term surface temperatures to detect any indications of drainage-induced effects. The magnitude of the albedo-induced {RF} was similar to that caused by the carbon sequestration of the growing trees. At three site cases out of four the drainage induced a cooling or negative {RF}, the tendency for cooling being higher at sites with a higher nutrient level. The differences in albedo-induced {RF} mainly arose from the spring season due to (1) the different snow cover duration in the south versus the north, and (2) the different albedos of drained and undrained snow covered peatlands. An increase in the maximum daily temperatures was observed in April in southern Finland, where the most intensive drainage practices have taken place, suggesting that forestry drainage has potentially affected the local climate. Our results show that the decreasing albedo resulting from peatland forestation contributes significantly to the {RF}, balancing out or even exceeding the cooling effect due to the changing {GHG} fluxes.},
